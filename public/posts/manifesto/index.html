I choose freedom over comfort.
I will not live in a cage, even if it&rsquo;s safe. I will face storms, hunger, and the unknown — because I was born to fly, not to be fed.


I build inner wealth.
Money is not the goal — clarity, time, and freedom are. I limit desires, not potential. I save, I invest, I build assets that serve my values.">

<li>
<p><strong>I choose freedom over comfort.</strong></p>
<p>I will not live in a cage, even if it&rsquo;s safe. I will face storms, hunger, and the unknown — because I was born to fly, not to be fed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I build inner wealth.</strong></p>
<p>Money is not the goal — clarity, time, and freedom are. I limit desires, not potential. I save, I invest, I build assets that serve my values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I act with intention.</strong></p>
<p>When I read, I read. When I work, I work. When I love, I love fully. Presence is power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am my own master.</strong></p>
<p>No one saves me. No system defines me. I break my own cage. I train my mind, guard my time, and fuel my spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I leave behind wisdom, not possessions.</strong></p>
<p>What lasts is not what I owned, but how I lived and what I taught. I live with simplicity, serve with clarity, and give with compassion.</p>
