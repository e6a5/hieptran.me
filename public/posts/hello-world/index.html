In this blog, I’ll be posting about:

My Learning Journey: Sharing the resources, tips, and experiences that have shaped my skills and knowledge.

Thoughts on Minimalism: Exploring how a minimalist approach influences my coding style and life in general.

Why &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;?
The phrase “Hello, World!” is often the first program written by newcomers to programming. It’s a simple way to demonstrate the basics of syntax and the joy of creating something from scratch. Just like that first program, this blog represents a starting point for my exploration of the tech world.">
