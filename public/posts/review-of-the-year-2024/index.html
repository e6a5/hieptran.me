    <p>As I reflect on the past year, I’m reminded of the moments that shaped my growth and understanding. 2024 was a year of learning, self-discovery, and laying the foundation for the future. I’ve captured five key takeaways from the year—four lessons from 2024 and one guiding thought for 2025—that I’m excited to share.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form … You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.&rdquo; - Charlie Munger</p>

<p>The best managers empower their teams, prioritizing support and growth over personal achievements. A leader who focuses on developing others creates a collaborative environment where everyone can succeed. This mindset has been invaluable in shaping my own leadership approach.</p>
