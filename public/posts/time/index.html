Because our life is finite.">

    <h1>Use Time With Love</h1>

    

    <p>How do you use your time every day?</p>
<p>What activity do you spend most of your time on?</p>
<p>Are you happy, or are you tired at the end of the day?</p>
<p>Are you truly living, or just existing in this universe?</p>
<p>These questions lead to the most valuable thing we have —</p>
<p>but often fail to recognize:</p>
<p><strong>Our time.</strong></p>
<p>Let it be.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why is time so valuable?</p>
<p>Because our life is finite.</p>
<p>Time slips away, even when we do nothing.</p>
<p>That’s why it matters how we use it.</p>
<p>That’s why we must learn to spend it wisely.</p>
<p>Spend time on what truly matters to you —</p>
<p>the people you care about,</p>
<p>the work that feels right,</p>
<p>the quiet moments that make you feel alive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Everything you do should come from love.</p>
<p>When you cook, do it because you care about feeding yourself or others well.</p>
<p>When you work, do it because you believe in what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>When you rest, do it because your body needs it.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t come from love, don’t do it.</p>
<p>Let it be.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s what love looks like in action.</p>
<p>But let’s step back for a moment.</p>
<p>What is love, really?</p>
<p>Love is what makes everything meaningful.</p>
<p>It’s why we create things.</p>
<p>Why we help others.</p>
<p>Why we keep going, even when things are hard.</p>
<p>Love turns ordinary moments into something special.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are human beings, not human doings.</p>
<p>We don’t act to show off or to please others.</p>
<p>We act because it feels right.</p>
<p>Because it comes from who we really are.</p>
<p><strong>We act because we are.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Today, I’m writing something.</p>
<p>And writing is a good use of my time.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
