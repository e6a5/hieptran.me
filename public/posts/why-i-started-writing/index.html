    <h1>Why I Started Writing</h1>

    

    <p>Today, AI can generate an essay from our ideas. With AI, I could simply review and publish an essay within minutes instead of spending hours or even days working on it. Using AI saves time and effort; all I’d need is an idea, and AI would handle the rest. It sounds easy, so why am I choosing to write myself?</p>
<p>First, writing is thinking. Writing well requires clear thinking, which isn’t easy. It pushes me to dig deeply into my thoughts and truly understand them. Why do I have certain ideas? How do they connect? Writing forces me to organize and consolidate my knowledge in a way that nothing else does.</p>
<p>Second, I love reading, and I read a lot every day. Reading brings in new ideas, while writing helps me make sense of them. If I just keep reading without ever writing, it feels like I’m only taking in information without doing anything with it. Writing helps me remember and understand what I’ve read—it’s my way of learning actively.</p>
<p>Finally, writing is a good habit. The more I write, the more I’m investing time in myself. Writing also helps me spend less time on social media or consuming endless online content. By choosing to write, I’m building a habit that keeps me focused and productive.</p>
<p>These are the three main reasons why I’ve started writing. Sometimes, we take on new challenges without clear reasons. But I believe that when we know why we’re doing something, we do it better.</p>
