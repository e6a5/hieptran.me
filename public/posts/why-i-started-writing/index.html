    <h1>Why I Started Writing</h1>

    

    <p>Today, we can use an AI to generate an essay from our ideas. It will take me a few minutes to review and publish my essay instead of spending hours, or days to finish my writing. Using AI will save my time and my effort. I just need an idea, AI will do everything else. It is easy but why I start writing.</p>
<p>Firstly, writing is thinking. To write well I have to think clearly. Thinking clearly is hard, I must truly understand my thoughts. Why did I have those thoughts? How to connect the things from my thoughts. It will help me consolidate my knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondly, I love reading. I read a lot everyday. Reading is the input. Writing produces the output. Reading a lot without writing, it just likes consuming the information on the newspapers. It will waste my time.</p>
<p>Finally,  writing is a good habit. I want to write well, I have to spend more time and effort. It will reduce my free time using social media, or consuming content on the Internet.
There are three main reasons why I start writing. Sometimes we start doing something without the reasons. But I believe when we know why we need to do it, we will do it better.</p>
