*Live Free. Build Deep. Serve True.*

1. **I choose freedom over comfort.**

   I will not live in a cage, even if it's safe. I will face storms, hunger, and the unknown — because I was born to fly, not to be fed.

2. **I build inner wealth.**

   Money is not the goal — clarity, time, and freedom are. I limit desires, not potential. I save, I invest, I build assets that serve my values.

3. **I act with intention.**

   When I read, I read. When I work, I work. When I love, I love fully. Presence is power.

4. **I am my own master.**

   No one saves me. No system defines me. I break my own cage. I train my mind, guard my time, and fuel my spirit.

5. **I leave behind wisdom, not possessions.**

   What lasts is not what I owned, but how I lived and what I taught. I live with simplicity, serve with clarity, and give with compassion.
