Today, it’s easy to generate an essay from just a few ideas using AI. In minutes, I can review and publish an AI-generated piece, saving time and effort that might have taken me hours, even days, to complete on my own. With AI, all I need is an idea—AI can handle the rest. But then, why am I choosing to write myself?

First, writing is thinking. Writing well requires clear thinking, which isn’t easy. It pushes me to dig deeply into my thoughts and truly understand them. Why do I have certain ideas? How do they connect? Writing forces me to organize and consolidate my knowledge in a way that nothing else does.

Second, I love reading, and I read a lot every day. Reading brings in new ideas, while writing helps me make sense of them. If I just keep reading without ever writing, it feels like I’m only taking in information without doing anything with it. Writing helps me remember and understand what I’ve read—it’s my way of learning actively.

Finally, writing is a good habit. The more I write, the more I’m investing time in myself. Writing also helps me spend less time on social media or consuming endless online content. By choosing to write, I’m building a habit that keeps me focused and productive.

These are the three main reasons why I’ve started writing. Sometimes, we take on new challenges without clear reasons. But I believe that when we know why we’re doing something, we do it better.
