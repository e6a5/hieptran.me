My mind has been changing a lot after the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of searching for the outside rewards, which may be out of our control. I have spent my time to understand what truly matter for me. I read more about philosophy, and try to answer a fews questions of my life. Who I am, what I'm doing. And oneday in 2021, I found a beautiful message from [Naval](https://x.com/naval): 

> "A calm mind, a fit body, a house full of love.
> These things cannot be bought - they must be earned."

Taking care of my health, my internal state, and my close relationships will bring me a lot more peace and happiness. 

How to have a calm mind? I searched it on Google and there were a lot of pratical tips and advices, but I was seeking something deeper. And then I spent whole of my free time to read about Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, and Zen. I finally I realized something: 

- Reality is only ever here and now. Freedom is found in presence. 
- Accept what is, everything in the universe always happens as the way it is, everything comes and goes as it is. 
- The best treasure is a sparing tongue - Hesiod 
- A good life is simple, clear, and unburnded.
- Freedom begins where ego ends. 

The preceding points sound like something religious than anything pratical. But they helped my mind changes a lot, I see everthing clearer, and bigger. And one day I noticed, my mind had changed, but my body did not align with my mind, it seems like I am imprisoned in my own thought. And I saw why that happened, I only read about them, I did not pratice anything real life, my body missed direct experience. And I started doing mediation, it is hard to start, it was easy to give up after a few minutes. But I keep doing it, after a few month I can do mediation for an hour a day. I always have beautiful time during doing mediation, my mind and my body are relaxed. And I want to bring that experience to my working time, how can I do that? Just only using my breath. When I feel I'm stuck in thoughts, or lost my energy, I pause for a few minutes, return to breath, and then I continue what I do. It is simple technique but I have my a lot, I don't get angry easily, and I get tired easily. I act like I'm working. And it's great. I have shared that technique for my co-workers but it seems like hard for them to return to their breath. Therefore, I decided to build something simple, which does not break their current working flow, which helps them easy to follow. And the [Zenta](https://github.com/e6a5/zenta) is created. It is for developers, who love terminal, and think its like their home. When you are stuck, simply typing 'breathe' command, observe your breathe, and you are here, in the present, right now. Zenta is simple and fun project. But it really works, because it solves a real problem, it brings we back to the present. 

Zenta helps you easy to observe your breath, it is great to start praticing with Zenta. But when you know how to observe your breath, maybe you do not need to use Zenta anymore. Anytime you feel you are lost in thought, you notice you are not in presence, you return to your breath, just in a few breath, you will back to the present. What I want to say in the end is how you can always be aware of mindfulness and practice it from within yourself. Not through external tools or conditions.

My post is over, let's take a breath.
