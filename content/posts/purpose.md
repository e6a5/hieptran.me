Sometimes, I feel lost in emotions.

They shift quickly. 

One moment I'm focused. 

The next, I'm chasing what others are doing.

That's FOMO. I recognize it. But just knowing is not enough.

I must learn to trust my own path and walk it, even when it is quiet.


To do that, I need to find what truly matters to me.

Not what's popular. Not what's trending.

But what brings real value and real meaning to me.


Our time is limited. 

If I’m lucky and healthy, I might live 90 years.

It’s a long life, but still a finite one.

So I ask myself:

What truly matters during my life?

What are the moments, the milestones, that give life meaning? 


Maybe they are not big events.

Maybe they are quiet moments of growth:

– **Learning something that changes how I think**.

– **Building something that matters**.

– **Finding people who walk the same path**.

– **Becoming someone I’m proud of**.


Life is not just something we live through.

It's something we design.

I don't have all the answers yet.

But I know the journey starts with asking the right questions.

And I'll keep walking, one step at a time.
