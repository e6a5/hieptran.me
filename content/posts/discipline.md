You know what you want.

You know what you need to do.

You start. You do it for a few days.

Then... you stop.

And what do you get from that? Nothing.

The truth is: if you only act when you feel motivated, you'll never reach your goals.

Discipline is different.

Discipline means doing it even when you don't feel like it.

Not because you hope it works, but because it's part of your life.

Don't wait for motivation. 

Build habits. Take small steps.

Stick the path.

The results don't come from your wishes.

They come from your consistent actions.

**Discipline is freedom.**

Slowly. Quietly. Daily. Without applause.
