Welcome to my sites! I’m Hiep Tran, and I’m excited to share my journey in the world of software engineering and technology with you.

In this blog, I’ll be posting about:
- **My Learning Journey**: Sharing the resources, tips, and experiences that have shaped my skills and knowledge.
- **Projects**: Updates on the projects I’m working on, including challenges faced and solutions found.
- **Thoughts on Minimalism**: Exploring how a minimalist approach influences my coding style and life in general.

### Why "Hello, World!"?

The phrase “Hello, World!” is often the first program written by newcomers to programming. It’s a simple way to demonstrate the basics of syntax and the joy of creating something from scratch. Just like that first program, this blog represents a starting point for my exploration of the tech world.

### What to Expect

I aim to keep my posts straightforward and insightful, focusing on practical knowledge and sharing what I’ve learned along the way. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or someone interested in the world of software development, I hope you find something valuable here.

Thank you for stopping by! Feel free to explore my posts, and don’t hesitate to reach out through my X account if you have questions or want to connect.

Stay tuned for more updates!
